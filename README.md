# Auditor-AI
# Cardano AI Auditor Agent

🚀 **A fully automated, privacy-aware smart contract auditor for Cardano, built with Midnight MCL and AI.**

## 🔥 Problem We Are Solving

Smart contract audits on Cardano today are:

- ❌ Expensive  
- ❌ Slow (weeks to months)  
- ❌ Hard to find experts (Plutus, Aiken, EUTxO)  
- ❌ No automated privacy audits  
- ❌ No Midnight MCL integration  
- ❌ No instant, shareable audit reports  

As a result, many projects deploy insecure contracts, especially during hackathons and in early-stage startups.

## 🌟 Our Solution: Cardano AI Auditor Agent

A one-click auditor that analyzes Cardano smart contracts — **Aiken, Plutus, EUTxO logic, Midnight privacy issues** — and generates a full security report instantly.  

💡 Think of it as:  
**"ChatGPT + CertiK + Midnight" for Cardano, fully automated.**

---

## 🎯 Demo Flow

### Step 1 — Code Input

- Paste Aiken/Plutus contract code into the editor
- Your UI displays the **Smart Contract Code** in a large editable box

### Step 2 — Click **RUN AUDIT**

The system performs:  

- ✨ AI reasoning (LLM analysis)  
- ✨ Rule-based checks for Cardano best practices  
- ✨ Syntax + semantic scanning  
- ✨ EUTxO logic flow mapping  
- ✨ Midnight privacy check  
- ✨ ZK/MCL compliance check

## 📋 Output Sections

### ✅ Audit Recommendation Box
- Summary: e.g., *“This contract contains critical issues. Review before mainnet deployment.”*  
- Buttons: Export MCL Template, View Code Fixes  

### ✅ Executive Summary
- Clear, easy-to-understand explanation of issues  

### ✅ Security Scores
- Security, Privacy, UTxO Logic represented in circular graphs  

### ✅ Detailed Risk Analysis
- 🔴 Security Risks: Missing data validation, hardcoded values, unsafe parsing  
- 🟡 UTxO Model Issues: Input/output mismatches, broken logic  
- 🔵 Privacy & Midnight Issues: Data exposure, zero-knowledge paths, MCL compliance  

### 🟣 Midnight Wallet Integration
- Devnet token ID and balance  
- Buttons: Top up, Spend (test)  
- Simulates private contract behavior in audit flow

## 🎤 Pitch Script (For Hackathons / Demo)

> “Today, smart contract audits on Cardano are slow, expensive, and require rare experts.  
> So we built the **Cardano AI Auditor Agent** — the first AI system that can fully audit Plutus, Aiken, EUTxO, and Midnight contracts automatically.  
> A developer pastes their smart contract code, clicks **Run Audit**, and the system instantly performs security checks, privacy analysis, logic-flow inspection, and Midnight ZK validation.  
> We also integrate a Midnight wallet to simulate private contract behavior and identify potential data leaks.  
> At the end, the system generates a full report with security scores, detailed findings, and auto-generated MCL code templates to fix privacy issues.  
> This makes audits faster, cheaper, and accessible to everyone — perfect for hackathons, startups, and rapid development teams.”

**Final Line That Wins Judges:**  
> “We didn’t just build an audit tool. We built the first-ever AI-powered privacy auditor for the Midnight era of Cardano.”
